Submitted by: **NAME** Medhanit Asrat Bekele

Time spent: **#** 6 hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [x] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
Stackoverflow.com and w3schools.com 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
I faced difficulties when I was implementing the optional features. Make the pattern random by creating an array of random numbers. I noticed that some of the buttons weren't in the clue pattern. To find out what was causing this, I printed the pattern. When I printed the random numbers, the numbers were floating point numbers. I multiplied the random numbers generated by 4, 4 is the range of the random numbers, so that the numbers will be between 1 and 4. The array of the random numbers generated contained 0. But we don’t have a button id 0 which caused some of the buttons not to be in the pattern. 0 was part of the random numbers because I used “floor” instead of “ceil”. “floor” rounds down but “ceil” rounds up.
The other challenge I faced was when I was implementing the timer. At first, after the timer started, I had trouble making it stop when stop was clicked. I fixed that by displaying the prompt message when the stop button is clicked. I had trouble changing from the prompt message to the timer when the start button is clicked. I googled ways to fix this and with the help of stackoverflow, I was able to come up with a solution. A way to change it using the paragraphs’ id. I made the script get the id and assigned the id to the timer variable. 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
I am now intrigued to know how to store and retrieve data, connect the backend code to the frontend, and create a successful communication system between the database and the HTML. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
I would rank users based on how quickly they finished the game and how high their score was. I would also allow multiple users to play the game on the site; each user would have their own profile page that they could access using a link. In a user's profile, I would add two progress charts; the first chart displays every user’s information like the amount of time it took to complete the game, how many guesses were incorrect, and two rankings, one for time and one for score. The second chart will be a personal progress chart with the same features. I will add a feature that penalizes for every wrong guess the user makes. I will add levels to the game where the clue play time will be shorter and more buttons.
